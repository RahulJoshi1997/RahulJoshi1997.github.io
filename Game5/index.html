        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>
            A racing game where players can't see the track, and have to rely on pulses of sonar to make things temporarily visible.
        </p>
        <p>
            This was an individual project, first prototyped using Lua in Pico-8 then remade using C# in Unity.
        </p>
        <h3>Gameplay:</h3>
        <p>
            Players race over the course of two laps. Staying on track makes them go faster, while using sonar pulses slows them down. Both players want to pulse as little as they can, while using the pulses of their opponent to see the track. However, racing without sight risks a very severe penalty for going off track.
        </p>
        <h3>Design and Development Details:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I wrote shaders in HLSL for the sonar effects.</li>
            <li>I balanced the penalty for pulsing to accomodate both skilled and beginner players:
            <ul style="list-style: disc">
                <li>Players slow down by 20% when they pulse, and they can't accelerate past that speed for a while. So players will accelerate as long as they don't pulse while their top speed is locked.</li>
                <li>This lock on the maximum speed is short for low speeds and long for high speeds. So it's easy to achieve a decent fun speed, but it's much more difficult to go faster, which makes the game fun for both beginner and expert players.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
