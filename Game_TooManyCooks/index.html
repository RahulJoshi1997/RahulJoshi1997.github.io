        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>
            This is a group project where we made a four-player tabletop game. The players are robot chefs living long after the end of human civilization, recreating human culture in an annual cooking competition.
        </p>
        <p>
            Like traditional human cooking, the competition is strategic and cut-throat. The chefs place ingredients to prepare a total of three dishes, but only the chef who places the last ingredient in the final dish wins.
        </p>
        <h3>Gameplay:</h3>
        <p>
            Players can draw ingredient cards into their hand. Placing those onto the board helps complete a dish, and it gets players tokens. They can spend these tokens to buy and use abilities. These abilities might let players change the state of the board, let them get more resources, or mess with the strategies of their opponents.
        </p>
        <p>
            So the game is a customizable card game where players choose abilities and balance their resources around a strategy. A part of the game is about tweaking these strategies to counter an opponents' abilities and resources.
        </p>
        
        <h3>My Role:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I worked with the team to create a narrative framing for the game and itâ€™s mechanics.</li>
            <li>I helped design and balance the abilities and balance the economy.</li>
            <li>I designed game systems like the market for skills, with the details of how it works, how it changes through the game, and how it responds to things like changes in turn order.</li>
            <li>I designed visuals for the board, ingredient cards, and other game materials.</li>
            <li>I iterated on the rules sheet's organization to make sure the game was easy to pick up and understand. I wrote up this structure and explained its rationale so that my teammates could implement it and make changes based on their own judgement.</li>
        </ul>
