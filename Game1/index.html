        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>
            This is a group project where we adapted "Axolotl" by Julio Cortázar: a story where the narrator is facinated by an axolotol until the day they become one. This game is about creating the atmosphere of fascination and introspection that leads to a sense of connection with the animal.
        </p>
        <h3>Gameplay:</h3>
        <p style="display: block;">
            Players can press their face against the aquarium and look around with the mouse to discover words. The players can use these words to fill in the blanks in their daily account of their experience. By choosing between words, players choose what the axolotl means to them. Each day ends with the story players have written so far.
        </p>
        <h3>My Role:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I coded the transitions seen when the game ends and when the player zooms into the aquarium tank.</li>
            <li>I also coded how the mouse controls the parallax effect.</li>
            <li>I made all the levels (the different days in the game) and arranged them.</li>
            <li>I decided on the artstyle that's used in the game.</li>
            <li>I made all the art assets used in the aquarium background, along with the face of Cortázar.</li>
            <li>I wrote the story with a groupmate and helped come up with the pool of words that the player could choose from each day. This writing was a major part of the design of the game.</li>
            <li>With all my teammates, I helped tackle how to adapt the story into game and nail down what the gameplay loop should be.</li>
        </ul>
