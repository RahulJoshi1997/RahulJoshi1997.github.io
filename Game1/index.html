            <h3><a href="https://solimporta.itch.io/axolotl">Play the game on Itch</a></h3>
        </div>
        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>
            This is a group project where we adapted "Axolotl" by Julio Cort&aacute;zar: a story where the narrator is facinated by an axolotol until the day they become one. This game is about creating the atmosphere of fascination and introspection that leads to a sense of connection with the animal.
        </p>
        <h3>Gameplay:</h3>
        <p style="display: block;">
            Players can press their face against the aquarium and look around with the mouse to discover words. The players can use these words to fill in the blanks in their daily account of their experience. By choosing between words, players choose what the axolotl means to them. Each day ends with the story players have written so far.
        </p>
        <h3>My Role:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I programmed transition effects and visual feedback systems in Unity C#.</li>
            <li>I came up with an artstyle that would suit the game, and drew a lot of the art assets.</li>
            <li>I iterated on the narrative design with a groupmate, ensuring that the game had an overall arc and that the players could meaningfully choose what they felt each day. </li>
            <li>As part of the narrative design, I made all the levels (the different days in the game) and arranged them.</li>
            <li>I designed the game mechanics with my teammates to effectively adapt the story and to give players agency in their ability to observe and narrate.</li>
            <li>I worked on many different aspects of this game. I took on resposabilities that let me reduce the workload of teammates facing a dispropotianate amount of work at different stages of development. I also collaborated more directly with teammates when our responsabilities overlapped to make sure the game came together as a cohesive whole.</li>
        </ul>
