        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>
            A puzzle where time moves forwards and backwards when you do. This puzzle was based on a story idea where someone outside our time and space lives out its lonliness, not precieved by any of us. This ghostly person tries to steal things people value so that others can feel its existance in some way.
        <p>
            This was an individual project made using Lua in Pico-8.
        </p>
        <h3>Gameplay:</h3>
        <p>
            The player is the ghost person, and their goal is to get the hat on the chair before the man picks it up. To achieve this, they need to use the fact that time moves with them only when their feet are touching the ground.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Narrative Design Details:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I used art to highlight the isolation of the player from the world. The player keeps blinking even when time is not moving for everyone else.</li>
            <li>Prompting the player to go left, I show a semmingly permanent separation between them and the man at the table. I use this moment to make players feel trapped in their isolation.</li>
            <li>I also literally trap the player with the elevator (seen in the first video below), to make sure that a strong part of the level's arc is players overcoming the cause of their lonliness: their own nature as a ghostly being.</li>
        </ul>
