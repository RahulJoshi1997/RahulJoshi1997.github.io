        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>
            This is a group project where we adapted "Axolotl" by Julio Cort&aacute;zar: a story where the narrator obsessively observes an axolotl and reflects until he is drastically transformed.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a four week project, made with C# in Unity. I worked with three other teammates on this game: Julian Cordero, Justin Ha, and John Sampson.
        </p>
        <h3>Gameplay:</h3>
        <p>
            Every day, players observe the axolol in an aquarium and discover words. They can use these words to fill the blanks in the narration of their experience. Each day ends with the story players have written so far.
        </p>
        <h3>My Role:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I programmed transition effects and visual feedback systems in Unity C#.</li>
            <li>I came up with an art style to support the game's mysterious atmosphere, and I drew a lot of the art assets.</li>
            <li>My teammates and I encouraged introspection by letting players modify the story with their interpretations, and we encouraged observation by revealing more meaningful words as a reward.</li>
            <li>I iterated on the narrative design with a groupmate. We made sure that the game had an arc and that players could meaningfully alter the story without undermining the atmosphere.</li>
            <li>As part of the narrative design, I made all the levels (the different days in the game) and arranged them for visual interest and to reflect the story.</li>
            <li>I worked on many different aspects of this game, taking on responsibilities in areas where a teammate was facing a surge of work due to design changes. I also collaborated more directly with teammates when our responsibilities overlapped to make sure the game came together as a cohesive whole.</li>
        </ul>
