        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>
            A twine game about myself written over the course of three weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
            The game takes the player through my memories to show how I view life: as something disorientating and dream-like, where events happen meaninglessly and yet have real emotional consequence, leaving me to wonder what they all mean to me.
        </p>
        <h3>Gameplay:</h3>
        <p>
            It's a traditional hypertext game where players click on words to make choices and continue the story. Often these choices make the story jump from one memory to another.
        </p>
        <p>
            The game ends with a sequence that assigns one of four possible meanings to my life.
        </p>
        <h3>Design Details:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I used the second person to place the player in my perspective and create a parallel between the player finding meaning in the story to me finding meaning in life.</li>
            <li>I wrote the links' anchor text say little about where they will lead, so that the player feels lost and the events of the story feel somewhat arbitrary and meaningless.</li>
            <li>I wrote the memories to be evocative and share a common sense of loss to give them emotional significance. This encourages the player to read the story as a collage with an overarching meaning and purpose.</li>
            <li>I end the game with the player arriving on a meaning to my life and then waking up from their dream. Finding meaning creates closure by making sense of the entire story. But I relegate this finality to a dream and highlight a continuing real world where events will change how I understand my life.</li>
        </ul>
